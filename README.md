    ðŸ‘‹ About me
</h1>

I am a french student who is passionned by computers. I am following a 3 year academic program, the 'BUT Informatique', that covers topics such as Linux, databases, web servers and programming. This year, I learnt C, RISC Assembly, JavaScript, jQuery, Java, jUnit, Apache, PostgreSQL, and more. Next year, I will be learning cryptography, advanced Java concepts, some JavaScript backend features like <code>await</code>, and Vue.js which is a web development framework.

Although my studies keep me busy, I like to learn more languages and tools in my spare time. For instance, I recently created a portfolio in Next.js 14, which allowed me to learn this framework, use Tailwind CSS, and write my first lines of backend as well.

I am now:
<ul>
    <li>Learning Angular (with some of its librairies like PrimeNG, PrimeFlex, ...)</li>
    <li>Creating a small game in python, playable in terminal</li>
    <li>Managing a linux machine that hosts multiple video game servers</li>
</ul>

I am planning on learning C#, .NET and WPF soon to create windows programs.

I am not sure yet in which domain I'd like to work:
<ul>
    <li>
        I find that cybersecurity is very interesting since it is always evolving. Its moral aspect aligns with my values.
    </li>
    <li>
        As I enjoy coding and mastering new programming languages, the DevOps field would be an ideal fit for my interests, as it demands extensive knowledge of a wide range of languages and tools.
    </li>
    <li>
        As I enjoy doing a bit of everything, full-stack development suits me perfectly. I love creating clean, reusable code components, developing both user interfaces and backend systems, and researching what is the most efficient way of doing things.
    </li>
</ul>
